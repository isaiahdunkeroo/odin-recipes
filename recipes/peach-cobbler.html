    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Peach cobbler is a classic Southern dessert that brings together juicy, sweet peaches and a buttery, golden-brown biscuit topping. Whether served warm with a scoop of vanilla ice cream or enjoyed on its own,
         this comforting treat is a favourite for summer gatherings, family dinners, or cozy nights in.</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>This recipe is simple to prepare and uses pantry staples, making it an easy go-to when peaches are in season—or when you're craving a taste of sunshine in colder months. The filling is rich with natural peach 
        flavour, lightly spiced with cinnamon, and perfectly balanced with a hint of lemon. The topping is soft yet crisp around the edges, offering the ideal contrast to the syrupy fruit beneath.</p>
